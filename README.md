# RF Comm Onboarding

Welcome to Snowbots! This repo is where you'll be working on an RF Comm onboarding challeng - to make multiple machines communicate with each other over WiFI through a router! The goal of this is to become comfortable working with C++ and ROS, and also be used to our development processes! This challenge will look a little intimidating at first, as we've been intentionally vague in several places, but this is so we can get you to **use the power of google** or to **ask us for help (that's what we're here for!)** for problem solving.

### The Router
Our test router for CIRC/URC, is an off-the-shelf router that you'll interface with via WiFi.

## The Problem
When you're assigned a project, it will be in the form of a Github Issue, so it's important that you can read and interpret them, and also ask for clarification if needed. You can read the issue for the this onboarding under the `Issues` page on this repository.

## The Learning Goals
Just when you thought this wasn't like school.... this onboarding aims to teach you the following things:
- interpreting requirements and clarifying potentially vague github issues
- C++ skillz
- general ROS knowledge
- experience with basic algorithm development

## The First Steps
1. Send commands and responses with 2 machines, as if one is the base computer and the other is a robot computer, via http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/MultipleMachines
2. Extend the poinr-to-point communcation by introducing a robot data server between the base computer and the robot computer. This server should do some light pre-processing on the data passing through it.
